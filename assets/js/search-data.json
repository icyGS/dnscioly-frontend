            "content": "Night at the Museum . Night at the museum was one of the most exciting nights of the week. There were so many cool and interesting exhibits there that were not only present in Computer Science but also in Ceramics, Art, 3d Animation, and Digital Mixed Media! . Our Experience . While other exhibits were fun and informative, we also had our own exhibit, which seemed very interesting. In particular, many of our visitees were super interested in the amount of detail and precision that was put into our login system. Another really cool part of our website that we showed off was our fun trivia quiz that we had! Those were questions that came directly from Science Olympiad, so it was really cool to see people trying their hardest to get them right. . Pictured here is Bailey Say attempting to answer some quiz questions . Here, Don is explaining what Science Olympiad is and how it works to a parent! . Nathan shows off the beautiful roster of students that is present on our website! . A group of people attempts to solve the quiz together! . Other exhibits . While our own exhibit was great, that is not the only reason that we were there. The other exhibits that we visited were really cool too! . Here, we can see us posing in front of the really cool Digital Mixed Media projects! . Here’s a giant donut that was made by a student in 3D Computer Animation! That would be truly delicious. . Here’s a really cool Octopus mug that was made in Ceramics! . Something for Dia de los Muertos that was made! .",
